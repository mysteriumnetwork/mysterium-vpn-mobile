* Connect Android phone, check if `adb` can see it:
```bash
adb devices
```

#### Setup Emulator
1. Download Android Studio
2. Android Studio comes with JDK preinstalled, but in case that version doesn't work, you need [JDK 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
3. Setup Emulator in Android Studio and start it

#### Run Android:
Install Android SDK, export `ANDROID_HOME` to SDK location, i.e.:

    ```
    More info: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android#generating-a-signing-key

- Setup values in environment:
```bash
export FASTLANE_ANDROID_SIGNING_FILE_PATH=... # full path
export FASTLANE_ANDROID_SIGNING_KEYSTORE_PASS=...
export FASTLANE_ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS=...
export FASTLANE_ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY_PASS=...
```

- Setup Fastlane, more info in *fastlane/README.md*

# Troubleshooting

### iOS build & run error

```bash
Command failed: /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c Print:CFBundleIdentifier build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/MysteriumVPN.app/Info.plist
Print: Entry, ":CFBundleIdentifier", Does Not Exist
```

`Entry, ":CFBundleIdentifier", Does Not Exist` error is very generic, but doing the following steps fixed the issue.
 
#### Xcode configuration
* Open project
* File -> Project settings -> Advanced
* Select "custom"
* Set the following:
   
    Products: build/Build/Products
    
    Intermediates: build/Build/Intermediates.noindex
    
    Index Datastore: Index/DataStore 
* Product -> Build

### Android build error
```bash
* What went wrong:
A problem occurred configuring project ':react-native-fabric'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration ':react-native-fabric:classpath'.
   > Could not find lint-gradle-api.jar (com.android.tools.lint:lint-gradle-api:26.1.2).

waiting on [fix](https://github.com/corymsmith/react-native-fabric/pull/208)

to fix run:
```bash
./util_scripts/fix-react-native-fabric-gradle
```

If you come across an error `command not found: gsed`, you can fix it on OSX by running:
```bash
brew install gnu-sed
```
